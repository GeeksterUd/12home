i created three files in html file i created a div inside that div i created a textarea and some span tags and also a heading in css i gave the styling
in java script file i get the element text and span by using get element by id method then on text i added a event listener keyup which call a function inside that function in one of the span tag which shows the total characters i show the total characters by using .innertext and to show the length i used .value.length
then for remaining charcters i subtracted the length of textarea using .getattribute(maxlength)- text.value.length
